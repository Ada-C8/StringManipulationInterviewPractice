## Comprehension Questions
What is the time and space complexity for each method you implemented? Provide justification.

|  Question 	|  Answer 	|
|---	|---	|
|  What is the time complexity of the string_reverse method? Provide justification.	| The time complexity is O(1) + O(n/2) = O(n)  	|
|  What is the space complexity of the string_reverse method? Provide justification.	|  Constant, only created variables that stored strings and integers.   	|
|  What is the time complexity of the reverse_words method? Provide justification.	|   The time complexity is O(n) because the loop ends at the end of the input.  So the time will increase linearly as the input size increases. 	|
|  What is the space complexity of the reverse_words method? Provide justification.	| It is constant.  We only created three variables that held integers.  So it only contained 6 bytes.     	|
|  What is the time complexity of the reverse_sentence method? Provide justification.	|  O(n), while there are nested conditionals/while loops, the array is only ever iterated across once.   	|
|  What is the space complexity of the reverse_sentence method? Provide justification.	|   	|
|  What is the time complexity of the palindrome_check method? Provide justification.	|   	|
|  What is the space complexity of the palindrome_check method? Provide justification.	|   	|
|  What is the time complexity of the encode_repeating method? Provide justification.	|   	|
|  What is the space complexity of the encode_repeating method? Provide justification.	|   	|
