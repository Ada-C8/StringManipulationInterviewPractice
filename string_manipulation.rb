# A method to reverse a string in place.
# Design and implement a method to reverse a string in place.
#    - e.g. original string = "Lovelace"
#    - reversed string = "ecalevoL"

#####HELPER METHODS
=begin Given a string, a starting index and a ending index, this will return a reversed version of that string
Time complexity = O(n) Because I step through every index in the array once.
Space complexity = O constant Because I only use one variable, the temp variable, regardless of how long the string is.
=end

def reverse(string, begin_index, end_index)
  ((1 + end_index-begin_index)/2).times do
    temp = string[begin_index]
    string[end_index]
    string[begin_index] = string[end_index]
    string[end_index] = temp
    end_index -= 1
    begin_index += 1
  end
  return string
end

=begin
Given a string it returns an array of the indexies that mark the stop and start of each word.
Time complexity = O(n) Because I step through every index in the array once.
Space complexity = O(n)? Because I make an array and the length of that array is dependent on the contents of the my_words array
=end
def words_index(my_words)
  words_index = []
  holder = my_words[0] != " "

  if my_words[0] != " "
    words_index << 0
  end

  my_words.length.times do |i|
    if holder == true
    words_index << i-1 if my_words[i] == " "
    elsif holder == false
    words_index << i if my_words[i] =~ /[A-Za-z]/ ? true : false
    end
    holder = my_words[i] != " "
  end

  if words_index.length % 2 == 1
    words_index << my_words.length - 1
  end

  return words_index
end

=begin
I call a helper method to do this. The answer is the same as for the helper method.
Time complexity = O (n) Because I step through every index in the array once.
Space complexity = O constant Because I only use one variable, the temp variable, regardless of how long the string is.
=end
def string_reverse(my_string)
  reverse(my_string, 0, my_string.length-1)
  return my_string
end

=begin
I call two helper methods
Time complexity = O(n) for index_array + O(n) for reverse +O(n) for this method (since I visit each word) = O(n)
Space complexity: O(n) for index_array + O for reverse +
O for this method =O(n)
=end
def reverse_words(my_words)
  #make an array of indexes for the start and stop of each word
  index_array = words_index(my_words)
  #reverse each word in place
  k = 0
  (index_array.length/2).times do
    start = index_array[k]
    stop = index_array[k+1]
    reverse(my_words, start, stop)
    k += 2
  end
  return my_words
end

=begin
A method to reverse the words in a sentence, in place.
Time complexity =O (n^2)Because: O(n) for each time I call the word_index outside of a times loop.  O(n) for each .times loop, and O(n^2) for each time I call the words_index method inside of the times loop. Overall that is O(n^2) + O(n) + O(n^2) + O(n^2) + O(n) + O(n^2) = O(n^2)
Space complexity = O constant.
Because: I make the word_index array, and a counter variable
independent to the size of the input. (Except, the array would get bigger depending on the input... but I don't know how to interpret that so for now I am going to treat the array as one thing and not consider its length.)
Note: There must be a better way to do this.  My way seemes too messy.

# A method to check if the input string is a palindrome.
# Return true if the string is a palindrome. Return false otherwise.
=begin
Time complexity: O(n)
Because: reverse the array, which is O(n).
Space complexity: O(n)
Because: I make a duplicate array that is the same size as the input array...0(n)?
